**Why Nvidia’s Stock Is More Than Just Hype**  
*By Ben Bernanke*

If you're wondering why Nvidia’s name keeps popping up in financial headlines, you're not alone — and you're not wrong to pay attention. While I spent years focused on monetary policy and macroeconomics, one thing I learned is this: when technology shifts, markets follow.

Nvidia’s rise isn’t just about gaming graphics anymore. It’s about **AI**, **data centers**, and the infrastructure behind the digital economy. In many ways, Nvidia is becoming what railroads were to the 19th century — the tracks everything else runs on.

Its stock performance? Impressive, yes — but also reflecting genuine demand for its chips in powering everything from ChatGPT to self-driving cars. Is it priced for perfection? Possibly. But in a world increasingly driven by computation, it's a name worth watching.

Sometimes, markets do get excited. But sometimes, they’re just early to a truth. Nvidia might be both.
